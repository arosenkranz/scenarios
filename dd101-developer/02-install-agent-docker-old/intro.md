Now that you are logged into your Datadog account and know how to use the training environment, it's time to install the Datadog Agent on your host. 

In this next activity, you will learn how the agent is configured in a Docker environment. Then you will ensure that traces and logs are collected correctly at both the host and application-level.

The objectives for this section are:

1. Install the agent in a Docker environment.
2. Configure the application's services for collecting trace metrics and logs.
3. Confirm logs and traces are displayed in the Datadog application.
