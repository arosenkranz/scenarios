The first step when working with Datadog is to configure the agent and ensure it is collecting the right metrics in your application.

In this activity, you will review how the agent is configured in a Docker environment. Then you will ensure that traces and logs are collected correctly at both the container and application-level.

The objectives for this section are:

1. Install the agent in a Docker environment.
2. Configure the application's services for collecting trace metrics and logs.
3. Confirm logs and traces are displayed in the Datadog application.
