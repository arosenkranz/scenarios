In this lab you're going to learn about Datadog integrations. As mentioned in the Agent discussion earlier in the workshop, there are many types of integrations. Core integrations are those that ship with the Agent and can be installed with minimal effort.

In this lab, you will:

  - Understand how core Agent integrations work
  - Configure an integration in Docker
  - Understand how Autodiscovery works
