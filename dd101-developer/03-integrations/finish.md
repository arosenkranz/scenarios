Congratulations! You you're now familiar with Datadog integrations, and you know how to install and configure popular core integrations in a container environment. Remember that configuring the Datadog Agent and integrations on a host is the same in principle, but would edit YAML files instead. All of the Datadog Agent configuration documentation covers all environments equally well. See the [integration docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/) for more information.
