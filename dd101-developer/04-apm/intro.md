In this lab, you're going to configure Storedog to capture application traces. This will give Storedog's developers the tools they need to send custom metrics and performance data to Datadog, and to monitor performance at the application level.

In this lab, you will:

1. Configure services with language-specific trace libraries to collect traces
3. Explore APM in the Datadog App
4. Examine the connection between application traces and logs
5. Enable and observe application profiling
