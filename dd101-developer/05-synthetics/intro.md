In this lab you will learn about two different types of synthetic tests available in Datadog:

  1. API Tests
  2. Browser Tests

You will create each of these tests to cover an important business function of Storedog. You will configure these tests to run automatically and to alert staff when they fail. This will give the Storedog organization peace of mind as they continue to rapidly enhance and grow their application. 

> **Note:** You will use the [Datadog test recorder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datadog-test-recorder/kkbncfpddhdmkfmalecgnphegacgejoa?hl=en) Chrome extension to record your tests, so make sure you use Chrome for this activity and install the extension.
