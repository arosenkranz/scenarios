Now that RUM is set up, metrics will be automatically generated by a running Puppeteer script. Let's also interact with the site as a user to generate some data we can look at later in Datadog.

1. To visit the Storedog website, click on the **Storedog** tab next to the terminal. It may take a few seconds to load.
2. Browse the site a bit like a real user might:
  1. Look at some products
  2. Search
  3. Add something to your cart
3. Since you enabled RUM with your RUM application information, while you were browsing, data was sent to Datadog. Let's take a look!
