You configure which parts of your cloud infrastructure are sending metrics, events, logs and other data into Datadog using integrations. 
Most integrations come out of the box with the Datadog Agent. 
You configure them individually to set up that part of your infrastructure to send data to Datadog. 
Datadog gives you a ton of flexibility in configuration options, and Datadog also has the ability to autodiscover parts of your environment when you set up the Agent.
So this module focuses on enabling and configuring the PostgreSQL integration on the container agent we set up and running in the last module.
