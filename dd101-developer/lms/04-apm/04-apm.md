As you know, modern software applications are composed of pieces of code that you update frequently, and which are spread across diverse infrastructure and middleware. This makes it challenging to find the source of performance problems. 

Is a sudden change in performance caused by:
an increase in error conditions? 
A slow database query? 
Overwhelmed hardware? 
A cloud service outage? 

Datadog brings all this data into one place, and correlates it with tags, so you can follow leads and drill into details. This makes predicting and solving problems much easier.
