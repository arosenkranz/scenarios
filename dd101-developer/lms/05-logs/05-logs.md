Large systems like the ones you work on produce thousands upon thousands of logs. They are stored in a multitude of places, with a variety of structures and content. 

Log aggregation brings all your infrastructure, integration, and application logs together into one location, where you can slice and dice by tag and time frame, and group the logs by commonalities. 

Datadog lets you see 100% of the most immediate logs, while also controlling which logs are retained for future reference.
