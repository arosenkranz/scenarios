Synthetic tests are automated, simulated tests -- on web app UIs or APIs -- that generate data and send it to Datadog.

Synthetic tests help you observe how your systems and applications are performing with simulated requests and actions from datacenters around the globe. 

The tests send their data to Datadog so you can tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels. It’s a controlled and stable way to do automated testing and alerting. Synthetic tests can find 
regressions, 
broken features, 
high response times, and 
unexpected status codes, for example.

Synthetic tests help you ensure that no defective code makes it to production. Or if it does, a synthetic test catches it, not one of your customers. This helps provide a consistent customer experience, ensuring your customers aren’t your first testers.

You can also compute Service Level Objectives on your key endpoints and user journeys This makes it easier to stick to your performance targets.
