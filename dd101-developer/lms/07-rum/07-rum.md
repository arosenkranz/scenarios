Real User Monitoring (RUM) gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users. 

RUM collects and visualizes data about actual users who are exercising parts of your software, so that you can track real-world performance and behavior of people, web pages, and mobile apps. 

RUM lets you see how your applications and infrastructure respond under real life conditions, from the front-end code to network requests. 

With RUM, you can monitor ongoing bugs over time and across versions. 

RUM also helps you make product decisions based on real data about user journeys, usage, and interactions, instead of based on guesses or what people say but donâ€™t really do.

Further, you can provide top-notch support to your users by accessing the actual data related to their problem in their own specific user session -- you can see actions they took, and what results occurred.
