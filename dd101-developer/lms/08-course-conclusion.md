Congratulations on completing **Datadog 101 for Developers**! Hopefully this course has left you feeling comfortable and confident in using Datadog in your day-to-day work. Let's review what you've learned:

* How the Datadog Agent is installed in a Docker environment and configured with Unified Service Tagging.

* That integrations are used to provide out-of-the-box dashboards and data processing for different types of application services and programming languages.

* How Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is configured and can be used to help identify performance issues across services with distributed trace data.

* The different ways log data can be queried, filtered, sorted, and visualized to provide you a clear picture in how your application is performing.

* Synthetic testing can be used to prevent a regression in the user experience.

* How to configure and analyze data captured from Real User Monitoring (RUM) to get a fuller picture on how users are interacting with your application and any issues they may come across.

While you covered a lot of material, this course is meant to just provide an idea of what you can achieve with Datadog. In reality, you've only scratched the surface. To continue your learning, it is encouraged you take other courses in the Datadog Learning Center that dive further into each topic. Some of these courses may be an extension of what you've learned here while others will introduce you to completely different aspects of Datadog.
