Previously, you used RUM dashboards and the RUM explorer to find and investigate your users were experiencing. By leveraging Session Replay and source map uploads with the Datadog CI library, you were able to not only get an accurate idea of what a user's journey was like, but also able to see exactly where and why they encountered an error.

While these tools are great for rooting out and fixing issues, it would be better if you were notified of these issues as they are happening. 

In this portion of the course, you will build a RUM monitor to detect and alert on issues that are happening in your application. Then you'll use RUM Analytics to help identify performance issues that you may want to address next. You will also explore some advanced features of RUM that allow you to gain a better understanding of how your users are interacting with your application.

**Activity Objectives**
1. Build a monitor to detect and alert on frontend issues.
2. Use session analytics to help identify where time should be spent investigating issues.
3. Configure RUM global context and custom user actions to help gather important information about how your users are interacting with your application.

> **Note:** If you didn't name your RUM application **Storedog** in the previous lab, the application will not build correctly on lab startup. You'll need to create a new RUM application with that name now, then refresh this page to continue.

When you are ready to continue, click **Start Scenario**.
