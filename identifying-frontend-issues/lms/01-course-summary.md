# Summary

Congratulations on completing the course! As you've learned, Real User Monitoring and Error Tracking in Datadog are powerful tools that can leveraged to improve the user experience of your application. By correlating RUM data with the rest of your application's logs and traces, you can see how your users interact with your application and how that interaction behaves and performs across your services, giving you a full picture of how your application is performing at both a technical and business level.

What's important to take away from this course is how to leverage these tools such as the RUM Session Explorer and Analytics, Session Replay, and Error Tracking to be proactive and on the lookout for issues that may disrupt your application's services and affect your users or business goals. 

Once you have that handled, see how you can use more advanced features such as custom actions and context to your RUM data to really get a sense of how users and customers can get the most out of your application.

To learn more about how to use Real User Monitoring and Error Tracking, be sure to check out the [Datadog RUM documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring).
