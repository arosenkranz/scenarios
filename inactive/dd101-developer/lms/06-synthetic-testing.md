# Synthetic Browser Tests

Synthetic tests are automated, simulated tests that are run against web app UIs or APIs to ensure optimal user experience.They help you observe how your systems and applications are performing with simulated requests and actions from data centers around the globe. 

The tests send their data to Datadog so you can track the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels. It’s a controlled and stable way to do automated testing and alerting. With synthetic tests, you can identify issues like the following:

- Regressions
- Broken features
- High response times 
- Unexpected status codes

Synthetic tests help you ensure that no defective code makes it to production. Or if it does, a synthetic test catches it, not one of your customers. This helps provide a consistent customer experience, ensuring your customers aren’t your first testers.

You can also compute Service Level Objectives on your key endpoints and user journeys, making it easier to stick to your performance targets.

In this lab, you'll be introduced to synthetic browser tests, where you'll use Datadog to test a web application's UI to ensure data populated by an API service displays correctly for the user.
