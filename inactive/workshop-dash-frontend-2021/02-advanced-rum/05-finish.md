Great work on using RUM to identify, fix, and put in preventative measures for issues in your applications. 

Not only can you use RUM for errors, but also for tracking performance optimizations and surfacing popular flows in the user experience, allowing you and your team to get a good look at how users are interacting with your application and where time should be spent on fixes.
