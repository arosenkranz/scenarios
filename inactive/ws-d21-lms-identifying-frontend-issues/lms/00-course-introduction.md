# Detailed Course Description

When working with web applications, it’s crucial to understand every type of issue that negatively impact the user's experience. Users often experience the effects of poor load times, transaction-stopping bugs, shifting views that cause unwanted interactions, confusing interfaces, and more. This not only makes them lose interest in your app and choose to bounce, but unnecessarily increases your rate of lost customers. 

Giving your front end team the superpower of being able to discover and mitigate user experience issues before they make it to production can revolutionize both your team’s workflow, and your business overall. Integrating the practice of Real User Monitoring (RUM) not only enables your team to understand where performance bottlenecks are occurring for your real users in production, but it gives them an observability framework in which to continually gauge, monitor, and be alerted to any user experience issue that’s relevant.

In this course, you’ll learn how to surface, triage, prioritize, and resolve the UX issues that are affecting an ecommerce app called Storedog. Using tools in tandem with RUM like Error Tracking, Session Replay, and APM will help you see how effective data collection can allow you to identify and address your application’s most urgent issues in the quickest way possible.
