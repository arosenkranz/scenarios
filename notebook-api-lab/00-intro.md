# Introduction

With Datadog, notebooks are commonly associated with incident management and postmortems, where they are used to help gather information about an incident and make it easy to share among team members and stakeholders. Well why wait for an incident? We can also use notebooks to document our work, share our knowledge, or even correlate data from Datadog with other sources.

In this lab, you'll learn how to use Datadog to create a notebook and add a few cells to it that visualize the overall health of your application over the course of a week. Then you'll correlate that data with release notes from GitHub that can help you understand the impact of your changes. This will give you a more complete picture of the state of your infrastructure and help you make better decisions about where to spend your time.

Not only will you create and update a notebook, but youâ€™ll also learn the different methods of sharing a notebook with colleagues or stakeholders, allowing teams to use Datadog as a central hub for reporting and monitoring their services to help discover trends and enhance workflows.

Let's review the learning objectives for this lab:

1. Create a Notebook through the Datadog app to get familiar with its features.

1. Utilize the Datadog API to retrieve and update a notebook with data from a third party.

1. Know how and when to use the different means of sharing a notebook.
