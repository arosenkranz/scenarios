# Introduction

With Datadog, notebooks are commonly associated with incident management and postmortems, where they are used to help gather information about a situation and make it easy to share among team members and stakeholders. Well why wait for an incident? You can also use notebooks to document work, share knowledge, or even correlate data from Datadog with other sources.

In this lab, you'll learn how to use Datadog and the Datadog API to build a notebook that holds both metric data and software release notes for an application. This will give you a more complete picture of the state of your application and help you make more informed decisions about where time should be spent.

Youâ€™ll also learn the different methods of sharing a notebook with colleagues or stakeholders, allowing your team to use Datadog as a central hub for reporting and monitoring your services to help discover trends and enhance workflows.
