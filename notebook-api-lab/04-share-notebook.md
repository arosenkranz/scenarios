You've already seen how a notebook's data is returned by the API, and while it's useful for performing programmatic tasks with its data, most of is not as meaningful unless it's being interpreted by the Datadog app.

Luckily, there are other means of sharing notebooks. Ones that can work with you and your team's workflow.

Head to the Datadog app to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/notebooks/list" target="_datadog">view your notebook</a>. In the upper-right corner of the page, you'll find the "Share" button. Select it and you'll see a dropdown list of sharing options for you to explore that looks like this image:

The first option, "Copy formatted contents", will copy the notebook's contents to your clipboard in a way that you can paste into a document or email. 

Try it out by selecting the option, opening a [new Google Docs document](https://docs.new), and pasting the notebook's contents into the document. The result will look something like this image:

The second option, "Download as PDF", will save the notebook's contents to a PDF file for you to share. Same with the "Download as Markdown (.md)" option.

Both of these options are great if you will update your notebook weekly and want snapshots of your reports before they are overwritten. 

The final option, "Export Notebook JSON", will export your notebook in a JSON format that matches the format that's returned by the API. This is useful if you want to backup your notebook data so it can be imported into different Datadog notebook at some point. 

Keep these options in mind when working with notebooks, as they can be integrated into your workflow in a number of ways.
