While you can run GET commands or simply export your notebook as JSON with the “Share” button at the upper-right corner, only Datadog will understand how to parse and display any metric data.

Instead, you can copy the entire notebook as pastable content, where the metric data will be grabbed and saved as an image. Do so now by selecting “Share > 
Copy formatted contents” and pasting the data into a new Google doc.

Conversely, you can save a notebook as a PDF or even Markdown. This is great if you want to save snapshots of your reports if you update your notebook weekly.

Congratulations on learning how to work with Datadog notebooks! Let’s review what you learned.
