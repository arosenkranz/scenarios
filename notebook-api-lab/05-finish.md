# Review

In this lab, you used both Datadog and the Datadog API to build a notebook that helps you correlate the work performed by your team to the overall health of your application. Take a moment review what you accomplished:

1. Used Datadog to build a new notebook that displays metrics for an application.
1. Leveraged the Datadog API to retrieve notebook data.
1. Added cell data to a notebook that was sourced from a third-party service using the Datadog API.
1. Explored different means of sharing notebook data and when they can be useful.

Now that you've seen what you can do with notebooks, think of some ways how you can use them to build documents that help you understand the impact of your work!
