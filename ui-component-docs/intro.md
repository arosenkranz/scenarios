# Introduction

In this scenario, we're going to inherit a UI component library built with React, styled-components, Prop Types, and Storybook, and step through how to build and document a React UI component.

Ensuring that a UI component looks and is used properly is important if the component library is to be utilized by a cross-functional development team or throughout the open source community.

This lesson assumes that you have working knowledge of React and CSS-in-JS technologies, and that you know how to configure a Storybook project. If you've never set up Storybook before, check out the [Storybook documentation.](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, we will accomplish the following tasks:

* Build a UI component using styled-components and React.

* Add variants and disabled state styles to a UI component.

* Integrate prop validation and default prop values using the Prop Types library.

* Document how to use a UI component with Storybook and MDX.

> **Important:** When starting the first step, please allow the GitHub repo to be cloned and installed.
