# Introduction

In this scenario, we're going to inherit a UI component library and step through how to build a React UI component and document it using styled-components, Prop Types, Storybook, and MDX.

Ensuring that a UI component looks and functions properly is important if a component library is to be used by a cross-functional development team or throughout the open source community. Having these components available and well-documented helps developers not only understand how to use a component, but can also support company-based processes such as onboarding a new team member to the design system.

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, we will accomplish the following tasks:

* Build a UI component using styled-components and React.

* Add variants and disabled state styles to a UI component.

* Integrate prop validation and default prop values using the Prop Types library.

* Document how to use a UI component with Storybook and MDX.

* Create an interactive sandbox for a UI component.

> **Important:** When starting the first step, please allow the GitHub repo to be cloned and installed.
