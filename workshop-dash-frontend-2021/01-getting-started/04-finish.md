Congratulations! You used Real User Monitoring tools to quickly find and fix an error within the application. The only issue is that you were still reacting to errors that users had and you may not have noticed them unless you were closely watching user sessions in the Datadog app.

Next, you're going to enhance your workflow by using monitors and analytics to detect errors as they're happening so you can identify them even faster.
