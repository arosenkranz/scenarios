When working with web applications, itâ€™s crucial to understand the different types of issues that negatively impact the user experience. Users can experience poor load times, encounter a transaction-stopping bug, or lose interest due to a confusing interface, all resulting in potential lost business. Having a solid grasp of the different types of metrics can help a team establish a workflow that can identify and fix these issues in an efficient manner. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to root out and distinguish the differences in issues that could be happening in your applications and ensure a consistently good user experience. With Error Tracking, Real User Monitoring (RUM), Session Replay, and Application Performance Monitoring (APM), you'll see how efficient data collection can help identify, prioritize, and address your applications' most urgent issues as fast as possible.
