We know there’s an error because we’ve experienced it first hand, so we have to assume there are others. The problem is that we can’t always predict the path a user will take when an error occurs.

Navigate to the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists" target="_datadog">**Dashboards List**</a> page and you'll find a list of dashboards provided to you by Datadog. Some of these out of the box dashboards are specifically designed to help you get a good overview of your Real User Monitoring data. These are all of the dashboards that start with **RUM** in the list.
